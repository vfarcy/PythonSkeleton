All the basics to get a new Pyhton project up and running.

Important recap 
	* virtualenv and pip make great companions, especially when use w/ the requirements feature of pip. Each project has its own requirements.txt file, so it's possible to install the dependencies for that project into its own virtual environment: env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
	* pip is a tool for installing packages from the Python Package Index.
	* virtualenv is a tool for creating isolated Python environments containing their own copy of python, pip, and their own place to keep libraries installed from PyPI.
	* It's designed to allow to work on multiple projects with different dependencies at the same time on the same machine.
	* After installing virtualenv, run virtualenv env to create a new environment inside a directory called env.
	* One of these environments is needed for each project. 
	* To use the versions of python and pip inside the environment, type env/bin/python and env/bin/pip respectively.
